## IJKL shortcuts plugin

This is a plugin which imposes `alt-ijkl` navigation shortcuts on currently open keymap.
The idea is that these shortcuts are more ergonomic for navigation and editing than using keyboard arrows
so you can stop using arrows in IDE editor.

These shortcuts were inspired by Vim and 
[gaming keyboard layouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_keys#IJKL_keys).


## Shortcuts

Editor navigation:
 - `alt-i` - line up
 - `alt-j` - move to previous word
 - `alt-k` - line down
 - `alt-l` - move to next word
 - `alt-n` - move left
 - `alt-m` - move right
 - `alt-u` - move to line start
 - `alt-o` - move to line end
 - `alt-f` - page down
 - `alt-w` - page up
 - `alt-shift-ijklmnuo` - navigate with selection

Editor text modification:
 - `alt-'` - code completion
 - `alt-l` - choose lookup item and replace
 - `alt-/` - cyclic expand word
 - `cmd-l` or `ctrl-l` - complete statement
 - `alt-;` - delete next character
 - `alt-d` - delete next word
 - `alt-y` - remove line
 - `alt-e` - expand word selection
 - `alt-shift-e` - shrink word selection
 - `alt-ctrl-shift-ik` - move statement up/down
 - `alt-cmd-shift-ik` (OSX) - move statement up/down

Search and advanced navigation:
 - `alt-a` - highlight usages in file 
 - `alt-s` - show usages popup 
 - `alt-shift-s` - find usages 
 - `alt-h` - jump to source
 - `ctrl-cmd-b` or `ctrl-alt-b` - implementations popup
 - `alt-b` - back
 - `alt-shift-b` - forward
 - `cmd-shift-[` or `alt-8` - previous tab
 - `cmd-shift-]` or `alt-9` - next tab
 - `alt-q` - close tab
 - `shift ctrl t` - reopen closed tab

## Why these shortcuts?

Because arrows are located too far from letters and it takes too much effort to move wrists.

When touch typing you would normally position your index fingers on letters `f` and `j`.
The problem is that writing/editing code is never linear and requires navigating around the code.  
This makes you to move right hand from `j` letter to arrows and takes a lot of effort.

With `alt-ijkl` shortcuts you won't need to use arrow again.

Another problem with arrow navigation is that left/right arrows jump only one character at a time.
You can use `ctrl-left/right` (or `alt-left/right` on OSX) to jump between words. 
This is more useful and, arguably, should be default navigation for arrows.
That's why in `alt-jl` moves caret to previous/next word.
Single character navigation is still useful sometimes, so it's mapped to `alt-nm`.
There is no particular reason for these letters except that they are located not too far from `ijkl`.

It's also extremely useful to navigate to start/end of line.
So the navigation to line start/end is mapped as close to `ijkl` as possible to `alt-u` and `alt-o`.
Navigate to start of line is `alt-u` because `u` is close to `j` and essentially also means moving caret left
and `alt-o` is end of line because it's about moving right 
(there is an implicit assumption here that you're coding in English which is written left to right;
if you're writing code in some other language, you might need to review your life choices).



## Conflicts with existing keymaps
TBD

## OSX Caveats

There are couple issues when using alt-ijkl shortcuts with built-in OSX keyboard layouts:
1. dead keys cannot be used as IDE shortcuts (e.g. `alt-i` in US layout)
2. if `alt-ik` are mapped to some character, then `Navigate to Class` action 
   handles `alt-ik` shortcuts as both navigation up/down and entering a character.
3. keys with certain output, when held down, trigger IDE action only once (e.g. `alt-i` with 'Ë†' output in US layout). 

The first two issues can be solved by adding keyboard input source which doesn't
have dead keys and doesn't output characters for `alt-ijkl` shortcuts. 
See section below.

To solve the third issue you can disable sticky keys feature by executing in shell 
`defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`. 


## How to install OSX input source

On IDE startup the plugin will suggest to add keyboard input sources.
In practice, this means that plugin will create `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ijkl-keys.bundle` directory with a bunch of files.

After input sources were installed, open OSX `System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources` and click on `+` to add input sources.

Choose `U.S. - IJKL` or `British - IJKL` input source from English category and click `Add` button.
(If you don't see these inputs, you might need to log out / log in or restart.)

Now you can switch to new input source in IDE and use `alt-ijkl` shortcuts.


## How to hide "default" input source

If you're happy with custom layout and want to hide built-in layout from input source list, 
[follow these steps](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/44921/how-to-remove-or-disable-a-default-keyboard-layout):
 - change the current input source to your custom keyboard layout
 - `open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist` (requires XCode)
 - remove the input source or input sources you want to disable from the `AppleEnabledInputSources` dictionary; 
   if there is an `AppleDefaultAsciiInputSource` key, remove it
 - restart
