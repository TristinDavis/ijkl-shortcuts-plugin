## IJKL shortcuts plugin

This is a plugin which imposes `alt+IJKL` navigation shortcuts on currently open keymap.
The idea is that these shortcuts are more ergonomic for navigation and editing than using keyboard arrows
so you can stop using arrows within IDE.

These shortcuts were inspired by Vim and 
[gaming keyboard layouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_keys#IJKL_keys).
